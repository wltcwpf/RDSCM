\title{Calculate Spatial Correlation Between Two Locations in California}
\usage{
CA_spa_cor(location_1, location_2, period, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{location_1}{A numeric vector of length two. The first element is longitude and the second is latitude.
Coordinates must be in decimal degrees using the WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326).
Note: This function currently only supports locations within California, USA.}

\item{location_2}{A numeric vector of length two. The first element is longitude and the second is latitude, using the same CRS as \code{location_1}.}

\item{period}{A numeric value indicating the oscillator period. Accepted values include \code{-1}, \code{0}, or any value in the interval \code{[0, 10]}.
If \code{period = -1}, it refers to peak ground velocity (PGV);
if \code{period = 0}, it refers to peak ground acceleration (PGA).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance level. Default is \code{0.05}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{estimate}}{The estimated spatial correlation between the two locations.}
\item{\code{interval}}{A character string representing the confidence interval for the estimate, formatted as \code{"[lower, upper]"}.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the estimated spatial correlation and its confidence interval between two geographic locations in California, based on a specified oscillator period.

location_1 <- c(-122.4194, 37.7749)  # San Francisco
location_2 <- c(-121.8863, 37.3382)  # San Jose
spa_cor <- CA_spa_cor(location_1, location_2, period = -1)
